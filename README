NAME
    WebService::Bluga::Webthumb - fetch website thumbnails via
    webthumb.bluga.net

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Bluga::Webthumb;
        my $wt = WebService::Bluga::Webthumb->new(
            user    => $user_id,
            api_key => $api_key,
            size    => $size,  # small, medium, medium2, large (default: medium)
            cache   => $cache_days, # optional - default 14
        );

        # get a thumbnail URL using the default settings
        my $thumb_url = wt->thumb_url($url);

        # Get a thumbnail URL overriding some settings:
        my $thumb_url = $wt->thumb_url($url, { size => 'large' });

Class methods
    new Create a new WebService::Bluga::Webthumb object. Takes the following
        params:

        user
            Your webthumb user ID, available from your
            http://webthumb.bluga.net/user page.

        api_key
            Your webthumb API key. also available from your user page. (This
            is used to construct the hash of the thumbnail URL, but not sent
            directly.)

        size
            The size of the thumbnail to generate. Size can be:

            * small - 80x60
            * medium - 160x120
            * medium2 - 320x240
            * large - 640x480

        cache
            How many days a generated thumbnail can be cached on the
            webthumb servers before a fresh one is generated. Generating a
            thumbnail uses a credit whereas serving up a cached one uses a
            fraction of a credit, so don't set this too low.

            If not specified, defaults to 14 days.

Instance methods
    thumb_url
        Given an URL, and optionally `size' / `cache' params to override
        those from the object, returns an URL to the thumbnail, to use in an
        IMG tag.

    easy_thumb
        An alias for `thumb_url'. This name was used in 0.01 to reflect the
        fact that it used the EasyThumb API rather than the full API;
        however, I think `thumb_url' is rather clearer as to the actual
        purpose of the method, and the implementation of it is somewhat
        unimportant, so consider this method somewhat deprecated (but likely
        to be supported indefinitely.)
